**Purrfect Diner**
A project for UBC's CPSC 210 course

**Welcome to Purrfect Diner's Game Instructions!** 

- To start the Game, you can either click New game or Continue game. 
- Once the game is started, you will see an order on the left side of your screen. 
- To add the order, click on the Tab at the right side of the screen
- You will then be promted to either add or not add your order 
- **NOTE**: you will have to add the order in order to proceed to the order creation stage of the game. 
(sidenote: picking yes or no in the page asking you to add orders does not have different effects, both options will add your order. You just have to pick an option)
- After adding the order to the tab, you then have the option to click the bowl at the bottom of the screen. 
- The bowl would then lead you to the "kitchen" where you can start adding ingredients to the bowl.
- If you forget the recipe (ingredients combo) to make a certian dish, you can click the "check recipe" button to check the recipe for your order 
- Click on the ingredient you want to add on the right side of the screen to add an ingredient to your bowl. 
- If you made a mistake in adding an ingredient, you would have to clear out the entire bowl (sorry :( ). 
- To clear out the bowl, click the clear bowl button to clear out your bowl. 
- Once you have added all the ingredients required for your order, you can click the serve order button. 
- If your order is served succsesfully (meaning that you got all the ingredients right) you will be brought back to the "resturant" where you will then recive a new order. 
- If your order was served unsuccesfully (meaning that you had one or more incorrect ingredients), then you will be brought back to the "kitchen" again, where you will have to clear your bowl (unfortunately) and re-add your correct ingredients. 
- If you would like to quit the game, you can click the menu button. 
- When you click quit, you will be asked if you would like to save the game. 
- **Note**: when you save a game, no matter what stage you are at, when you click contiue game the next time you play, only your order will be saved. This means that you will have to add your ingredients again, no matter if you previously added ingredients. 

- **NOTE** : all graphical components in this game (background, button icons, etc) are hand drawn by me, they can be found by asking me.
